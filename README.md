Emojis are deeply flawed. They:
- lack a lot of emotional cue ("Ok 🙂" are you being sarcastic? passive-aggressive? annoyed?),
- their meanings change depending on who you're texting to (which can cause misunderstandings if you don't use them correctly, not just on an interpersonal relationship with your family and friends but people from different cultures and nationalities),
- their appearances vary greatly on each platform,
- heavy Japanese-American (💹 why yen? 🏈 appears first when you search "football emoji") and lack of other countries' cultural symbols and references (where are emojis for Vietnamese _bánh mì_, Indian _sari_, or Mayan _Chichén Itzá_?),
- a product of Silicon Valley (American tech companies corportize emojis by making them have big eyes, big mouth, and yellow skin).

For a paralanguage that's being used by billions of people, and with LLMs like ChatGPT using it, it's nowhere near universality. **It's time to reject [emojipocalyspe](https://www.openbible.info/blog/2015/05/heralds-of-the-emojipocalypse/) and return to emoticons and kaomoji.** I'm aware they aren't perfect. Emoticons, like emojis, are susceptible to semantic shift, while kaomojis are disruptive and only for social signaling. **Still, they're the only way to reject emojipocalyspe, else how can we express emotional cue via text?** Not everyone uses stickers and GIFs, and they aren't supported on every platform.

Emoticons and some basic kaomojis can easily be typed via your keyboard, but most kaomojis, especially complex ones, can't or is awkward to do so. You would have to either copy-paste somewhere on the internet, save them as text shortcuts, or use your OS features/app/keyboard like Windows Clipboard Manager, [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/yalishanda/kaomoji-search), or using Japanese keyboard.

On mobile, there's Gboard that has kaomoji, but not everyone is comfortable with Google collecting data. Other kaomoji keyboard apps don't have the ability to neatly use kaomojis from the keyboard while you're typing like Gboard. Because of this fact, I've been meaning to create an app.
